                        Apple, or LinkedIn), LiveSnap receives and stores
                        information about your account from that service for
                        authentication purposes. This information could include

                        your account (for example, your Facebook UID), profile
                        picture, and any other basic account info you've made
                        publicly available. Additionally we may store your
                        Facebook friends list and LinkedIn connections to
                        recommend others to you or to recommend your account or

                        your privacy settings on third-party services you have
                        permitted to access your account, like&nbsp;

                        by visiting a corresponding third party service page. If
                        you unlink your third party account, we will no longer
                        receive information collected about you in connection
                        with that service, but you’ll be unable to access your
                        LiveSnap account through that third-party service.

                        <br /> LiveSnap may disclose User information if we
                        believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary
                        to comply with US state and federal laws (such as U.S.
                        Copyright law) or other applicable laws around the world
                        (for example, in the country of your residence); or
                        respond to a court order, judicial or other government
                        subpoena, or warrant in the manner legally required by
                        the requesting entity.
                        <br />
                        <br /> LiveSnap also reserves the right to disclose User
                        information that we believe, in good faith and after
                        making reasonable inquiries, is appropriate or necessary
                        to take precautions against liability to LiveSnap;
                        protect LiveSnap from abusive, fraudulent, or unlawful
                        uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against
                        third-party claims or allegations to protect the
                        security or integrity of the LiveSnap Service; or to
                        protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
                        LiveSnap, our Users, or others. We will notify you of
                        these disclosures if we reasonably think we can do so
                        legally and without harming the purpose of the
                        disclosure.

                        Like many other sites on the Internet, LiveSnap uses
                        cookies—small text files containing a string of
                        alphanumeric characters. LiveSnap uses cookies and
                        collects IP addresses and other automatically collected
                        information in order to better facilitate the services

                        data for marketing and research purposes. If you accept
                        the cookies used on our site, we may be able to identify

                        in order to safeguard your information. While we take
                        precautions to protect sensitive information that’s

                        offline. Only employees who need the information to
                        perform a specific job, such as billing or customer
                        service, are granted access to personally identifiable
