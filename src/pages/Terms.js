            live stream video content on behalf of others or as a service. For
            example, if you work for a company and your job is to live stream
            company content, you must register for one of our "for companies"
            plan; if you are a digital marketing agency producing live video
            broadcast for agency clients, you must register for our “for

            <br />
            You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your
            Account, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by you
            or a third party. Therefore, you should contact us immediately if

            <br /> The term of this Agreement (“Term”) shall commence, and you
            may begin using the Services, when you agree to these Terms of
            Service by completing the registration process for your Account and

            <br /> 4.2 Termination by You for Convenience
            <br />
            <br /> You may terminate this Agreement for any reason or no reason
            at all, at your convenience, by:
            <br /> (a) providing us written notice of termination in accordance
            with Section 16.2 below,
            <br /> (b) closing your Account for any Service for which we provide
            an Account closing mechanism, or
            <br /> (c) with respect to a Trial Account, through no action other
            than letting the trial period expire and never again accessing your
            Account.

            <br /> 4.2.1. Account Closure
            <br />
            <br /> If a Paid Service is subject to a minimum Service term, or
            has been prepaid for a defined period, your Account shall be closed
            immediately unless you specify that the Account is to be closed at
            the end of the minimum Service term described in the applicable
            Service Description on the Site at the time of purchase, or at the
            end of the prepaid period.
            <br /> If such Paid Service requires an advance notice of
            termination (cancellation), your Account shall be closed at the end
            of the advance notice of termination (cancellation) period as
            described in the Service Description on the Site at the time of
            purchase.
            <br /> Upon termination, all of your stored content and channels
            shall be removed from LiveSnap’s servers and systems (i.e., LiveSnap
            does not cache your social media platform credentials – your user
            name(s) and password(s) shall be deleted upon Account closure).
            <br /> No refunds of prepaid, unused fees shall be issued due to
            your decision to close your Account unless (a) LiveSnap has suffered
            a general network outage or problem which prevented you from using
            your Account for a period of at least seventy-two (72) consecutive
            hours, or (b) you have encountered other issues with access to the
            Site and our support team has been unable to resolve such issues in
            the seven (7) day period after your issue is reported.

            to a less expensive Monthly Plan, or when changing plan types at

              must submit a ticket per this section 4.2.2 to officially
